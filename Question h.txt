There could be some general cases which may result in such behavior,

Random Variable : The application may be using some random variable, like random number generator or a specific time of the day or a user input etc which may be causing this.
Uninitialized Variable : May be there is some uninitialized variable, which takes an arbitrary value each time and those values are causing such drastic behavior.
Memory Leak : The program may have run out of memory, maybe heap overflow or something.
External Dependencies : The program may depend on some other application which is causing this.
Other process on machine : Maybe there are some other processes, running on machine causing it.
We can approach this problem by elimination, like close all other applications in the system or use some runtime tools to dig deeper when the problem occurs.
